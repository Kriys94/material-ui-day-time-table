## Install

`npm i material-ui-day-time-table`

## Usage

This component is pretty flexible.
It allows you to style your tables how you wish, while also trying to remain flexible with the format of your data.
To accomplish this, there are a number of functions which you must supply for how to access the data.
Most of them are fairly trivial.

See
[storybook](https://ezralalonde.github.io/material-ui-day-time-table)
for demos, and [storybook source](stories/) for reference.
It's quite simple.
There are examples using [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) for nice times.

The source is the definitive reference.
